# Google OAuth Verification - Scope Justifications

## Application Overview
**App Name:** ModelGrow
**App Type:** Automation Platform
**Purpose:** Allows users to create, run, and manage workflow automations that integrate with Google services

---

## Sensitive Scopes Justification

### 1. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send

**Why we need this scope:**
ModelGrow enables users to create automated workflows that send emails on their behalf. Users explicitly configure email automations (e.g., sending invoice notifications, automated follow-ups, or summary reports) and approve each automation before it runs.

**How we use it:**
- Users create automations that include "Send Email" actions
- The automation sends emails only when triggered by the user or their configured conditions
- Email content is generated based on the user's automation configuration
- Users maintain full control and can disable any automation at any time

**User benefit:**
Automates repetitive email tasks like sending notifications, summaries, or alerts based on data from spreadsheets or other sources, saving users time and ensuring timely communication.

**Data handling:**
- We only send emails when explicitly configured by the user in their automation
- We do not read, store, or access the user's existing emails
- Email content is generated from user-defined templates and data sources
- We do not sell or share any user data with third parties

### 2. https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets

**Why we need this scope:**
ModelGrow allows users to create automations that read from and write to Google Sheets as a data source or destination. Common use cases include invoice tracking, data aggregation, report generation, and database synchronization.

**How we use it:**
- Users select specific spreadsheets to use in their automations
- Automations read data from sheets (e.g., invoice details, customer lists)
- Automations write results to sheets (e.g., logging automation runs, updating status)
- Users explicitly configure which spreadsheets each automation can access
- All operations are performed only when the user's automation runs

**User benefit:**
Enables powerful data workflows like automatically extracting invoice data and logging it to a tracking spreadsheet, syncing data between systems, or generating reports from multiple data sources.

**Data handling:**
- We only access spreadsheets that users explicitly select for their automations
- Data is processed in real-time during automation execution
- We do not store spreadsheet data permanently on our servers
- Users can revoke access at any time by disconnecting their Google account
- We do not sell or share any user data with third parties

## Non-Sensitive Scopes Usage

### https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file (Per-file access)

**Purpose:** Create and manage files (folders, documents, spreadsheets) that are generated by user automations.

**Usage:** When users run automations that need to create output files (e.g., "Create a folder for invoices", "Generate a tracking spreadsheet"), we create these files in their Google Drive. We only access files that our app creates, not the user's existing files.

## Additional Information

### Application Architecture

**Platform Type:** Web-based automation platform (Next.js application)

**User Flow:**
1. User signs up and creates an account
2. User browses available automations or creates custom workflows
3. User connects their Google account via OAuth 2.0
4. User configures automation parameters (which spreadsheet, email template, etc.)
5. User explicitly runs or schedules the automation
6. Automation executes only the user-approved actions
7. User can view results, logs, and disable automations at any time

### Security & Privacy Measures

**Data Protection:**
- All API credentials are encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption
- OAuth tokens are stored securely in our database with encryption
- We use HTTPS/TLS for all data transmission
- Access tokens are refreshed automatically and securely
- Users can revoke access at any time through their Google account settings

**User Control:**
- Users explicitly approve each automation before it runs
- Users can enable/disable automations at any time
- Users can disconnect their Google account at any time
- All automation actions are logged and visible to users
- Users control which specific files/spreadsheets each automation can access

**Data Retention:**
- We do not permanently store user's Google data (emails, spreadsheet content)
- Data is processed in real-time during automation execution
- OAuth tokens are deleted when users disconnect their account
- Automation logs are retained for 90 days for debugging purposes

**Compliance:**
- We comply with GDPR and CCPA data protection regulations
- We have a clear Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
- We do not sell or share user data with third parties
- We do not use user data for advertising or marketing purposes

### Test Accounts

We can provide test accounts for Google's verification team to review:
- Test user accounts with sample automations
- Demo automations showing Gmail and Sheets integration
- Access to our staging environment for security review

### OAuth Consent Screen

**User-facing information:**
- Clear description of what each permission allows
- Link to Privacy Policy and Terms of Service
- Support contact information
- Option to revoke access at any time

### Scope Usage Justification Summary

**Gmail Send Scope:**
- Used exclusively for sending user-configured automated emails
- No access to reading or managing existing emails
- User maintains full control over email content and recipients

**Spreadsheets Scope:**
- Used for reading/writing user-selected spreadsheets in automations
- Enables data-driven workflows and automation tracking
- User explicitly selects which spreadsheets to use

**Drive File Scope:**
- Limited to per-file access (not full Drive access)
- Only creates/manages files generated by our app
- Does not access user's existing Drive files

### Support & Documentation

**User Documentation:**
- Comprehensive guides on connecting Google account
- Tutorials on creating automations with Google services
- FAQ on permissions and data access
- Privacy and security best practices

### Business Information

**Company:** ModelGrow
**Type:** SaaS Automation Platform
**Target Users:** Individuals and businesses who want to automate repetitive tasks

**Data Monetization:** We do not monetize user data - revenue comes solely from subscriptions

### Technical Implementation

**OAuth Implementation:**
- Standard OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
- Refresh tokens stored securely for long-term access
- Incremental authorization (request only needed scopes)
- Token expiration and refresh handled automatically
- Secure redirect URIs configured in Google Cloud Console

**API Usage:**
- Gmail API: Used only for sending emails via users.messages.send endpoint
- Sheets API: Used for reading/writing spreadsheet data via spreadsheets.values endpoints
- Drive API: Used for creating files via files.create endpoint (per-file access only)

**Rate Limiting & Quotas:**
- We respect Google API rate limits
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Monitor quota usage to prevent abuse
- Users are notified if quota limits are reached
